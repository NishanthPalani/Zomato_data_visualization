# Zomato_data_visualization

## What is Zomato?
Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. It was founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in more than 1,000 Indian cities and towns, as of 2022â€“23. Zomato rivals Swiggy in food delivery and hyperlocal space

## Problem Statement
Zomato is a popular restaurant discovery and food delivery service. Data analysis on the platform's data could be used to gain insights into customer preferences and behavior, as well as identify trends in the restaurant industry. In real world these data could be challenging to analyze and interpret. Inorder to make it easy we will use data visualization techniques that can be used effectively to communicate the insights from Zomato data analysis to a wide range of stakeholders, including restaurants, food industry players, and investors
